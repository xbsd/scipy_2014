# **Your friend Crono has been murdered by the mighty demon Lavos!
# Luckily, you have a time machine, the good ship Epoch.  You and 
# your friends hatch a scheme to save him by replacing him with a 
# doll that looks just like him.**  
# 
# **Unfortunately Crono had the time machine too and you are not exactly 
# sure when he died.  Thankfully the Epoch's logs keep a record of 
# who visited which time periods.**
# 
# To save Crono, and foil the plans of Lavos, you must:
# 
# 1. Seach through the ship's log and print all of the times Crono was alive.
# 
# 2. Figure out if you ever left Crono alone, and if so, when?
#    Write these time out to a separate table with fully reading
#    the log into memory.
# 
# 3. Send three friends into the fray to help Crono out in 
#    his time of need.
# 
# 4. Who are Crono's best friends?  Who are his worst?  Judge 
#    based on the amount of time they spend with him.
