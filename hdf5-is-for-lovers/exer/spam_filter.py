# **Email today is just the worst.  It seems that 3/4 of time, the message is just 
# total junk while only 25% of emails are actually worthwhile.**
# 
# Somehow It is now your job to eliminate all of that spam for everyone at work, 
# leaving behind only the eggy goodness. You suspect compression might be able to
# aid you in your quest.
# 
# 1. Create an HDF5 file which contains a single emails array, uncompressed.  
#    Close this file and use the getsize() function to report the size on disk.
#    Time how long this took and print that out as well.
# 
# 2. Repeat step 1 but with zlib compression at level 1.
# 
# 3. Repeat step 1 but with blosc compression at level 5.
# 
# 4. You realize that spam is often vacuous.  What if the unwanted elements
#    weren't already tagged.  Repeat step 1, leaving the data uncompressed
#    but without filling in spam everywhere.
# 
# 5. Repeat step 4 but with blosc compression at level 5.
# 
# 6. How long does it take to read these arrays in?
