# **Create a metric boatload of random people.  That's right, create a table of 1000 random people on boats.**
# 
# 1. Define the description.  This should include:
# 
#     * First names
#     * Last names
#     * Lattitude and longitude, together
#     * List of ships which they have sailed on, min 1 but at most 5
#     * Lost at sea status
# 
# 2. Use the rand_sailor function to write a table of all of these people.
# 
# 3. Resuce patrols are dispatched by quarter.  Using the lattitude and 
#    longitude, create groups representing the NE, NW, SE, and SW and place
#    smaller tables of just these sailors.
# 
# 4. Rescue patrols also need up to date information on whether a not 
#    a person is lost.  Create two tables (lost & found) in each of the 
#    four directions which approriately elliminate the lost-at-sea status.
