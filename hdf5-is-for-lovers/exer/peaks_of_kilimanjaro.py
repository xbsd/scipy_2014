# **Your brother is going on an expidition to build a bridge between the two
# peaks of Mount Kilimanjaro.  He needs you to create a database of information 
# about the team.  This needs to include:**
# 
# I. A table of critical team member information.
# 
# II. An array of oxygen depravation fraction (to be filled in later)
#     for everyone team member for each of the million steps up the mountain.
# 
# The info he has about the team is their first name, last name, age, and 
# whether they are alive or not.
# 
# Suddenly, he has forgotten the first half of team's names.  
# 
# III. Please read these off for him.
# 
# Careful out there!
