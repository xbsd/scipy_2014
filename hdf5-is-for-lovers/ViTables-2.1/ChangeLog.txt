	added.

** Oct 22, 2008 **
	More progresses in the datasets displaying:
	- the workspace and the tree of databases are synchronized now: if a leaf

		is automatically selected in the tree

		node has been renamed or a node has been pasted/dropped) the views are
		closed

  expanded in the tree viewer. The reported Qt4 error was:

  QObject: Do not delete object during its event handling!

  I've been unable to locate exactly where the bug was. Apparently it was
  produced by a strange interaction between VTApp and VTGUI classes so
  I've embedded VTGUI in VTApp and removed the vtgui.py module. It seems
  to fix the bug.

** Jul 07, 2008 **
  The porting of the nodeProperties subpackage has started.

  A new module, nodeDoc.py, has been added. It is in charge of the

  The vtgui.py module porting is done. The result is a module much
  shorter and clearer thant it was before.

** Mar 19, 2008 **
  The porting of the vtgui.py module has started. It has been greatly
  simplified.

  The drag and drop behavior of the tree of databases view has been
  debugged a little bit.

  PyQt4.QtXXX libraries are now imported as QtCore and QtGui instead of
  qtCore and qtGui. In addition a couple of modules have some minor
  changes.

** Mar 18, 2008 **
  Copy, cut, paste and delete operations have been implemented in the
  tree of databases model. Overwriting has not been considered yet.

** Mar 05, 2008 **
  Basic drag and drop of the tree of databases model/view works!
  Nodes can be moved from one location to another (even in a different
  file). Nodes that belong to files opened in read-only mode cannot be
  dragged. Lazy population of the model works fine too.

** Mar 03, 2008 **
  The basic model/view implementation for the tree of opened databases
  is done. Databases can be opened and closed. The object tree of a
  given database is populated in a lazy way so that performance is
  guaranteed when opening files with a large number of nodes. Finally,
  icons are tied to nodes in the tree view.

** Feb 29, 2008 **
  Drag and drop support is being implemented.

** Feb 27, 2008 **
  Added basic support for renaming nodes in-place.

** Feb 26, 2008 **
  Added support for custom context menus to the tree of databases view.

  Some modules have been changed in order to keep internal consistency.

  Minor modifications made in several modules.

** Feb 22, 2008 **
  The h5db subpackage has been updated. Calls to Qt3 methods have been
  moved to Qt4 equivalent methods.

  nodes subpackage has been updated. Calls to Qt3 methods has been
  replaced by calls to Qt4 methods.

** Feb 20, 2008 **
  createIcons function changed: removed a line that was commented out.

  The nodes subpackage migration has started. Calls to Qt
  functions/methods have been adapted to Qt4.

** Feb 18, 2008 **
  The following modules have been ported:

  * scripts/vitables
  * vitables/utils.py
  * vitables/vtsplash.py
  * vitables/vtSite.py
  * vitables/vtgui.py 
    This module has been split in two modules: logger class is defined
    in a new module now.
  * vitables/logger.py

  The whole preferences subpackage has been ported:
  * vitables/preferences/vtconfig.py
  * vitables/preferences/preferences.py
  * vitables/preferences/configException.py

  The following tests have been ported:
  * vitables/preferences/preferencesGUI.py
  * tests/preferences/test_vtconfig.py
  * tests/preferences/test_preferences.py

** Dec 16, 2007 **
  The Spanish translation has been updated.

  WhatsThis help texts and some About... texts have been reformatted in
  order to improve the code readability.

** Dec 14, 2007 **
  The previous bug fix in the editing of the TITLE system attribute was
  incomplete. It has been corrected now (hopefuly).

** Dec 13, 2007 **
  Fixed a bug in the editing of the TITLE system attribute (accents
  raised errors).

  Some trivial enhancements have been done.

  The editing of user attributes has been improved. Overflow cases are
  now properly detected and a ValueError is raised. Although this is not
  the default behavior of numpy arrays (which are silently converted to
  the apropriate dtype when an overflow occurs) it seems more adequated
  for an end user application as ViTables.

** Nov 29, 2007**
  Drag and drop of nodes has been debugged. Cut and paste has been improved.
  I hope that editing nodes is now implemented in a quite robust way.

** Nov 28, 2007**
  The behaviour of the documentation browser has been improved.
  A couple of bugs have been fixed:
  - canceling the Open File... command works fine now
  - opening a new documentation browser doesn't give errors due to not found
    documents
  - trying to open a document that doesn't exist don't shows a blank page but a
    page with the message 'Document Not found'

  A mess due to the use of backslashes still happened on Windows platforms,
  specially in the list of recent files and in the navigation browser history
  and	bookmarks. This problem has been hopefully solved.

  The copy and paste operation has been enhanced. Now a node can be copied and
  pasted in its parent group. The overwrite dialog is raised, giving you the
  chance to rename the pasted node. If you decide to overwrite, the operation
  fails (a PyTable exception is raised) because a node cannot be overwritten
  by itself.


** Nov 27, 2007**
  The template script that generates the Windows installer has been updated.
  Now it takes care of the available translations.

  Unittests have been updated.

  The search method for locating the application settings has been improved on
  Mac OS X platforms.


** Nov 26, 2007**
  Spanish translation added.

  A couple of minor problems have been fixed:
  - the .vitables directory is not created on Mac OS X platforms anymore
  - the message raised when a directory is dropped on the tree viewer is now
    clearer

  The User's Guide has been updated.


** Nov 23, 2007**
  Displaying of objects in tables widgets has been enhanced. Now cell contents
  are dynamically adapted to the available room. It means that how the content
  of a given cell is displayed depends on the column width. As a consequence,
  the displaying of multidimensional objects has been greatly improved.

  Some changes aimed to improve the i18n have been done.


** Nov 21, 2007**
  Fixed a bug in the creation of user attributes with dtype float32.

  Errors raised during user attributes editing are displayed in the attributes
  editing dialog, not in the logger. This make easier to user to realise that
  an error has been raised.


** Nov 19, 2007**
  The release version has been updated.

  The User's Guide source has been updated.

  The DocBrowser behavior has been enhanced. Opening a file for the very first
  time in the DocBrowser uses the home directory as a working directory.
  Before it used the installation directory which was ugly.


** Nov 02, 2007**
  Fixed a bug in the access to VLArrays elements. The bug avoided the creation
  of views for VLArrays.

  VERSION has been updated in vtSite.py. This is required in order to run
  properly on Mac OS X platforms because on these platforms the module is NOT
  overwritten by setup.py.

  The temporary database is not removed when quitting ViTables because on
  Windows platforms a Permission denied error is raised.


**Oct 31, 2007**
  Explicit support for addressing 64 bit space has been added. Now ViTables
  can display tables with more than 2**32 rows with no problem.

  A small bug has been fixed (hopefully) in the node paste operation: pasting
  a node on an expanded group doesn't refresh the object tree i.e. the pasted
  node is not visible.

  The whole unittest directory has been updated/refactored/debugged.

  I forgot to update tests/test_all.py in the previous commit :-(

  Fixed a small bug in the File Save As... procedure. The file extension of
  the new file was generated in a wrong way because the full filepath was used
  to determine the extension. The right thing is to use the filename.

**Oct 30, 2007**
  The Users' Guide has been updated.

  A specific icons has been given to the toobar button in charge of opening
  files so that users can appreciate that it can show a popup menu now.

  Fixed a bug in File --> Close All and Query --> Delete All. Closing a set of
  non selected nodes caused a wrong update of the QAction in charge of
  closing all open files. Deleting a set of non selected filtered tables
  caused a wrong update of the QAction in charge of deleting all filtered
  tables.

  Fixed a bug in the procedure used to close a database. A race condition has
  been removed.

  A new icon has been added.

  Fixed a bug in the updating of query QActions. The bug couldn't be
  appreciated by users because it happened when the application was about to
  exit.

**Oct 26, 2007**
  The VERSION file has been updated.

  A new usability enhancement has been added. The Open button of the File
  toolbar is able now to open the file of Recent files too.

**Oct 22, 2007**
  Fixed a bug in the initial setup of the application.

  Fixed a bug in the Properties dialog of empty groups.

  Creating and renaming node operations have been made more robust.

  Fixed a small problem of name qualification when accessing to a couple of
  PyQt attributes.

**Oct 19, 2007**
  Usability of Properties dialog has been improved by fixing the visual
  behavior of attributes editing.

  The format given to catched errors has changed again. Now the readability of
  Syntax Errors is better.

  In the Filter Table dialog ValueErrors are explicitely catched now.

**Oct 18, 2007**
  Some classes still were instantiated via apply(qt.QSomeWidget.__init__,
  (self,args)). Now qt.QSomeWidget.__init__(self, args) is used.

  The behavior of tables shown in the Properties dialog has been improved.
  Tables have been resized so that they occupy all the available horizontal
  space leaving no (anoying) gaps.

**Oct 17, 2007**
  Fixed a small bug in the console that produced a wrong color update in some
  situations.

  Wild imports have been completely removed.

  The examples directory has been updated.

**Oct 16, 2007**
  The management of application preferences and configuration has been
  improved. The code has been simplified and a small bug has been fixed.

  Some error and warning messages have been changed in order to ensure that all
  of them have a consistent format.

**Oct 15, 2007**
  The resize mode of the Tree Viewer widget has been fixed so that the widget's
  header resizes properly its sections when the widget is resized.

  A subtle bug has been fixed in the setup of the default configuration of the
  application.

**Oct 11, 2007**
  Some logger messatges have been changed in order to make them
  self-explanatories.

  The installer template script has been modified. The name of the installer
  includes the kind of license now.

  Fixed a small bug in the File Save As... command. It avoided open files
  overwriting on Windows platforms.

  The format used for display catched exceptions has changed. Now it is more
  readable (although provides less information).

**Oct 10, 2007**
  The format of docstrings has been updated. Now every docstring has a
  restructured text format.

  Docstrings of every module have been updated. In particular the updated
  sections are those that listed the names of classes, methods, functions and
  global variables contained in the modules.

  Code for moving a node from one location to a different one has been changed
  in order to improve the performance.

**Oct 04, 2007**
  Fixed a bug in the paste node procedure.

**Oct 03, 2007**
  The behavior of the Query results node of the tree view has been setup
  accordingly to its aim.

  A subtle bug has been fixed in the dbView.py module. When dealing with
  nodepaths os.path.join should be avoided in favour of tables.utils.joinPath.
  The reason: in Windows platforms os.path.join can produce paths with a mix of
  slashes and backslashes.

  A small bug in the template installer script has been fixed. The uninstaller
  didn't remove completely the ViTables entry from the Start menu.

  Fixed a bug in the opening file process. When the open file dialog was
  called for the first time (i.e. application startup) and the dialog was
  cancelled then later calls of this dialog were unusable.

  The procedure for saving a file with a different name has been slightly
  changed to avoid a nasty HDF5 error. The error was raised when the new file
  name was filename (with no extension) and a filename.h5 file already existed.

**Oct 02, 2007**
  As no evaluation versions are going to be distributed the dbManager template
  is not needed now. That's why it has been renamed to dbManager.py

  Unneeded and obsolete files have been removed.

  A small bug has been fixed in vitables/nodes/leafView.py. The bug was raised
  by a bug in the underlying PyTables 2.0.1

  The ViTables configuration has been updated. The Startup option `start in
  current directory` is now `start in home directory` to avoid opening
  unexpected directories in Windows and Mac OS X when ViTables is launched by
  double clicking its desktop icon.

  Fixed a small bug that prevented to start ViTables in the home directory
  (when configured to do it) in Windows platforms.

  The template script for generating installers has been modified to add more
  items to the Start menu: links to documentation (in both PDF and HTML4
  formats) and to the examples directory.

**Oct 01, 2007**
  The users' guide has been updated.

  A check has been added to several methods in vtapp.py, to ensure that
  filepaths do not contain backslashes because they produce a real mess in the
  Windows registry and the list of recent files.

**Sep 30, 2007**
  Added a button for group creation to the Node toolbar.

**Sep 29, 2007**
  Fixed a bug in the drag and drop of a node from a read-only file to a
  read-write one.

**Sep 28, 2007**
  QActions updating and synchronizating panels strikes back!
  The last approache has been discarded because it didn't encompass every
  possible case. The new approache seems to work better and it is simpler.

  Fixed a bug that prevented empty nodes to be added to the object tree when
  the tree was expanded.

  Fixed a bug in the creation of new groups. Now the new group can overwrite
  any node with the same name placed in its parent group. Before only groups
  could be overwriten.

**Sep 27, 2007**
  The Help Browser history and bookmarks are now stored in the configuration
  file instead of in their own files.

  Fixed a bug in the updating of the QActions state.

**Sep 26, 2007**

  Windows registry) instead of in its own file.

  unittests have been updated.

**Sep 25, 2007**

  been removed. Now this information is stored in the application configuration
  file (or in the Windows registry).

**Sep 24, 2007**
  Fixed a small bug in the recovering last session process.

**Sep 23, 2007**
  Unittests have been updated.

**Sep 22, 2007**

  now their selection state synchronized.

  Several keyboard accelerators added.

**Sep 21, 2007**
  A couple of small usability improvements has been added. The action
  Node-->New group has a keyboard accelerator now.

**Sep 20, 2007**
  The dialog raised when a node editing leads to a naming problem is now more
  readable a.k.a useful.

  into a different one.

**Sep 18, 2007**
  A small bug has been fixed in the renameDlg.py module.

  Fixed a bug in the implementation of tables queries. The bug caused wrong
  values to be displayed in the query indices field (if requested) when the
  range of rows to be queried was other than (start=1, stop=n, step=1)..

**Sep 17, 2007**
  A small bug has been fixed in the dbView.py module.

  The unittests under tests/h5db have been updated.

**Jul 23, 2007**

  Use a `make.sh` script instead of `make` to build Mac OS X DMG images.
  The process is not complete yet, since the license is not shown on opening
  the DMG image.  That's why the `SLA.*` files are still in place.

  Now they take care of the LICENSE.html file.

  Makefile for unix has been simplified.

  Added RTF readme to DMG image with important details for Mac OS X.

  The xml source of the User's Guide has been updated.

**June 20, 2007**
  The mingwm10.dll library must be included in the installed ViTables because
  qt and pyqt have been compiled dinamically with the MinGW compiler. The
  Makefile mswindows/Makefile_windows and the template NSIS script
  mswindows/vitables.nsi.in have been modified to take care of this dependency.

**June 15, 2007**
  Added a Confirm Uninstall page to the template NSIS script.

  Several changes intended to allow for generating user's guide in a Windows
  box have been introduced.

  dialog ctors because this widget uses to be the application main widget,
  which is always accessible through the qt.qApp.mainWidget method.

**May 14, 2007**
  The methods for iterating over tree views have been refactored.

  has been moved to other modules. The xxxEditor modules have been removed from
  the project.

**May 12, 2007**
  Fixed an annoying bug that produced lots of error messages when a new
  database was created/open. It was caused by a bad interaction between
  VTApp.slotUpdateActions and DBManager.openDB methods.

  Several internal operations have been simplified. The code of the whole
  application is now clearer.

**May 11, 2007**
  The utils.py module has changed. The function getNode has been moved to

  A bug has been fixed in the NodeDoc.move method. The bug caused that views of
  small tables werent properly displayed after a drag and drop operation.

  The way of accessing the DBDoc instance tied to a given item of the tree view
  item (i.e tied to a TreeNode instance) has been simplified.

  reimplemented.

**May 05, 2007**
  The mechanism for renaming and deleting nodes has been enhanced and debugged.

  A translate method has been added to some modules that (due to recent
  changes) need it now.

  simpler and more stable.

**May 04, 2007**
  The coupling between leavesManager.py and dbManager.py modules has been
  removed.

  Started a heavy refactorisation of the treeEditor subpackage.

  The group creation and renaming of tree view items in-place have been
  completely recoded.

**May 02, 2007**
  Fixed a bug in node deletion: deleting a group with views didn't close the
  views.

  Module nameConflictDlg.py strongly refactored.

**Apr 30, 2007**
  Drag and drop management is now simpler:
    we have got rid of the nodeDrag module
    information about drags is now encoded via QTextDrag method

**Apr 27, 2007**
  Some methods of treeView module have been moved to the utils module.

  The vtInputBox module has a changed. Now it can be called more easily and
  used in a more consistent way.

  The implementation of the model-view-controller in the leaves manager has
  been fixed for renaming and dropping operations. Some minor changes have
  been done to descendants of NodeDoc class.

**Apr 23, 2007**
  The queries management has been enhanced in several ways. On the one hand
  performance of the filling of the result table has been increased when a
  column for selected indices is required by user. On the other hand usability
  of the query dialog has been improved in some aspects.

**Apr 14, 2007**
  A couple of bugs have been fixed:

  - the action Close view is inactive when the selected item is a group.
    However there was a LeavesManager.closeGroup method designed for closing
    every opened view under the selected group when the Close view action was
    launched.

  - the icons dictionary was recreated every time an icon was required by the
    application. It caused the openRecentFile action not to work at all. On the
    other hand the nodeProperties subpackage has been refactored and
    simplified.

**Apr 11, 2007**
  The nodes subpackage has been refactored and simplified.

  - vtTableItem.py

**Mar 26, 2007**
  The VTTableItem class has been refactored.

  disappeared and other have been added. In order to see if a Table has nested
  field the colnames attribute cannot be used anymore. One can use the
  colpathnames attribute for that purpose.

  zoomCell.py and buffer.py modules refactored.

**Mar 22, 2007**
  zoomCell.py and buffer.py modules refactored.

  ViTables dependencies on numarray package are being removed. The numarray
  functionality is now provided by numpy. As a consequence numarray will not be
  included anymore in the ViTables installer for Windows. Instead numpy will
  be included so the numarray license has been substituted by the numpy one in
  the 3rd_party_licenses directory.

  The examples directory has been updated. Most of the .h5 files are now
  PyTables 2.0 files.

**Mar 19, 2007**

**May 18, 2006**
  A new indicator has been added to the status bar. The indicator permanently
  shows the path of the item currently selected (if any) in the tree viewer.

**May 16, 2006**
  A view for the selected leaf (if any) of the tree viewer can be opened/closed
  by pressing the plus/minus keys, in the very same way that group nodes can be
  expanded/collapsed.

**May 15, 2006**
  Keyboard focus indicators have been added to the tree viewer and the logger
  in order to improve the application usablility, specially if you are moving
  around using the keyboard instead of the mouse.

**April 28, 2006**

  Implemented a mechanism to ensure that, if an error occurs when a dataset is
  being accessed, the application cursor will not remain frozen in its clock
  shape.
