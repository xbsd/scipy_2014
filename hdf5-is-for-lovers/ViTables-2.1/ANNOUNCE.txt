Announcing ViTables 2.1
=======================

After a long period retired from development activities I'm happy to come back
and present ViTables 2.1, the latest release of this viewer for PyTables/HDF5
files.

As it happens with the entire PyTables family, the main strength of ViTables
is its ability to manage really large datasets in a fast and comfortable
manner. For example, with ViTables you can open a table with one thousand
million rows in a few tenths of second, with very low memory requirements.
Also important is the fact that it is designed to be a multiplatform
application, i.e., it runs flawlessly in Unix (and hence, GNU/Linux), Mac OS
X and Windows. The fact that it runs on top of PyTables ensures its speed and
memory efficiency.

In this release you will find some bug fixes and usability enhancements. New 
features include:

- improved queries. They are faster and eat much less memory
- a simple but flexible plugins framework
- human friendly formatting of times and dates for PyTables native Time fields
  and also for time series created via scikits.timeseries package
- datasets can be imported/exported from/to files with CSV format

Platforms
---------
At the moment, ViTables has been fully tested only on GNU/Linux and Windows
platforms, but as it is made on top of Python, PyQt and PyTables, its
portability should be really good and it should work just fine in other
Unices.
